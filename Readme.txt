This is the repository for the C# MDF file parser that I originally demoed at Miracle Open World 2011.

Please note that this code is highly experimental. Lots of stuff and special cases are either not supported or outright ignored at this point. While the code is under development, it's current state is purely prototypical.

If you have any comments, suggestions or fixes, please let me know.
